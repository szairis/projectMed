<!--<p>Medical education is constantly adapting to conform with the changing
face of the health care industry.  Physicians are increasingly
expected to be actively publishing researchers, and the larger field
of medicine is shifting away from the private practice model toward
the academic hospital setting.  The recent trend among top medical
schools toward allocating more protected research time in the medical
school curriculum, including our own Columbia College of Physicians &
Surgeons, parallels these changes.  Traditional cornerstones of
medical coursework like gross anatomy are being abridged in favor of
semester-long courses in biostatistics and critical literature
review.  The message is clear: medical students should weigh their
potential career paths with a strong eye toward the sorts of research
they find appealing.</p>

<p>It is quite surprising, then, that there has been no effort put
forward by medical schools or organizations such as the AAMC to
actually facilitate the pairing of a highly skilled and motivated
student body (read: workforce) with relevant research opportunities.
I emphasize "skilled" because of the vast proficiency gap which
exists, on average, between attending physicians and medical students
in domains such as data analysis and computing skills.  I emphasize
"motivated" because medical students are, by now, well aware that a
strong research background can factor as heavily as any transcript or
board score when applying for residency positions.</p>

<p>projectMed.org is a web service designed specifically to connect
medical students across the country with research projects relevant to
their career pursuits.  It will function as a simple cascade of
research project listings tagged with key fields such as medical
center affiliation, relevant medical specialty, and a form for
students to contact the investigator on the listing.  Attending
physicians, the players with direct access to troves of valuable data,
will post structured descriptions of active research projects, thereby
directly tapping into a pool of high quality potential collaborators.
Research postings from within the university setting would be free of
charge, while a fee would be required for large corporations
advertising proprietary research projects.</p>-->
